### Mathematical Operations

The basic operations that one does on a neural network really fall into two categories. Forward propagation, or the passing of data into and through subsequent layers of the model to arrive at an output, and back-propagation, or the calculation of the gradient of each parameter in the model by stepping back through the model from the loss function to the input. 

*Forward Propagation*

Let our neural network with $l$ layers: $N$ have an input $X$ with $k$ covariates of interest and a target output of $y$.
